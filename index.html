            <h2 id="first">What is Extreme Sports?</h2>
            <p>There is no precise definition of an 'extreme sport' and the origin of the term is unclear but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by marketing companies to promote the X Games and when the Extreme Sports Channel and Extreme International launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012). <br> <br>
            While the term "extreme sport" is widely used to describe many different activities, there's debate over which sports fall into this category. Despite this, there are common traits shared by most extreme sports. Though they are not exclusive to young people, these sports generally appeal to a younger audience. They are rarely included in school physical education programs. Unlike many traditional sports, extreme sports are usually more solitary; however, rafting and paintball are notable exceptions as they involve teams. <br> <br>

            Activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional sports due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain-related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event. <br> <br>
                
            In traditional sports, athletes compete in controlled environments. While events like the X Games aim to provide a controlled setting, certain environmental factors remain unpredictable. For snowboarders, snow conditions can change; for climbers, the quality of rock and ice varies; and for surfers, wave height and shape are never constant. <br> <br>
                
            While traditional sports often use specific criteria like distance, time, and score to evaluate performance, extreme sports rely on subjective and aesthetic assessments. This approach means that unified judging methods are not typically used. Instead, each extreme sport develops its own standards and ideals for evaluation. These standards are flexible and can adapt to new trends or developments within the sport. As a result, the way performance is judged in extreme sports can vary widely, making it unique and dynamic compared to traditional sports. This flexibility allows for creativity and innovation, ensuring that the sports continue to evolve and remain exciting for both participants and spectators..</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The term "extreme sports" started to be used separately from "sports" around the 1950s. The Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University, England was founded by David Kirke, Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and Alan Weston. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day bungee jumping, by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol, England. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge in Colorado, sponsored by and televised on the popular American television program That's Incredible! Bungee jumping was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers. <br><br>
            The club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at St. Moritz, Switzerland, in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London double-decker bus, wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers. <br><br>
            Certain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, windsurfing was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a surfboard with a sailing boat's propulsion system (mast and sail). Kitesurfing on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of kite buggying (a parafoil) with the bi-directional boards used for wakeboarding. Wakeboarding is in turn derived from snowboarding and waterskiing.
